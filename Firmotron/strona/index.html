					(Marty takes a shot and it's way off the mark.) Hey listen, can I try that again? Sure, go ahead. (Marty shoots several times and each time he hits his mark. The salesman is at a loss as Marty holds the gun back out to him.) Hey, just tell me one thing...where'd you learn to shoot like that? (Doc puts his hands in his pockets. He feels the letter and pulls it out. He looks at it then holds it out to Marty.) What's the meaning of this. You'll find out in thirty years. It's about the future, isn't it? Wait a minute. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday… Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Uh, no, no, no, no. (Notices that Marty is watching them.) What are you looking at, butt-head? Yeah! (Marty crouches behind a car to avoid being seen.) Is this your ball, you want it back? Yeah! (He throws it into a gutter on a house.)

					(Dad aims again.) Hey look, I made a mistake! You're damn right you made a mistake! (Dad aims again.) Argh!Right. Well, good luck, for both of our sakes. See you in the future. (pats Marty on the shoulder.) You mean the past. Exactly!(he moves off to the side so he won't get run over.) Ready Marty? (starting up car) Ready!Nobody calls me chick- (1955 Marty exits the gym, slamming the door on his future self's head and causing 1985 Marty to fall over. Neither Marty sees the other, and Biff luckily doesn't see that there's two of them. Biff turns to 1985 Marty. He can sees that Marty has the almanac.) What the hell? (He takes the almanac.) You steal my stuff? (He kicks Marty in the stomach.) Whoa! And this one's for my car!I think so...whoa, what a headache! (to Bartender) Listen, you got a back door to this place? Yeah, it's in the back. C'mon, Doc, let's go. (they move to leave) Are you comin' out here, runt, or do I have to go in there after ya?It'll shoot the fleas off a dogs back at 500 yards, Tannen, and its pointed straight at your head!! (Tannen motions to his gang and they all lower their guns.) You owe me money, blacksmith. How do ya figure? My horse threw his shoe. Seein' you was the one who done the shoeing, I figures you was responsible.

					Look, Doc, maybe it was mistake. Maybe that grave wasn't yours. There could've been another Emmett Brown back in 1885. Did you have any relatives here back then? (shakes his head 'no') The Browns came to America in 1908, and then they were the Von Brauns. My father changed our name in World War I. Doc! Look! (Thumbing through photos, he has found a picture of Doc on September 5, 1885 in front of the brand new clock now in the clock tower.) Oh! Great Scott! It's me! Then it is true. All of it. It is me who goes back there...and gets shot.My dad told me about these. It is Wild Gunman. (He walks over to the game.) How do you play this thing? Let me show you kid. (He takes his hat off and throws it on top of the game.) I'm a crack shot at this. (Marty fires at the game and sure enough, he's a crack shot. The words "Crack Shot" appear on the screen.)Why am I always the last one to know about these things? (George goes over and opens the front door to reveal Biff waxing the undamaged car.) See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Just finishing up the second coat now. Now Biff, don't con me.(w.t) He's got the book, the old man's gone too. I'm locked in Biff's garage. (Lyon Estates) (v.o) You've gotta fly the DeLorean over here and get me the hell out of here. (cut to Garage) The address is 1809 Maple Street. (Lyon Estates) I can't take the DeLorean out in the daylight, but don't worry Marty, somehow I'll get over there.

					Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Right. (All of a sudden all the clocks in the room begin going off. It's very loud.) Are those my clocks I hear?(Biff gets out of the DeLorean. The top of his cane breaks off and stays in there.) Oh, oh, ahh! (Marty and Doc are running down the street carrying Jennifer.) She encountered her future self and went into shock, just as I predicted. She'll be fine - lets get her back to 1985. And then I'm going to destroy the time machine! Destroy it? What about all that stuff about humanity? Where we're going and why?
